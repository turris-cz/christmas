# Christmas

Shine Turris router like a Christmas tree.


## Description

A Python daemon for Turris router to blink its RGB LEDs like a Christmas tree.

This script uses `rainbow` command and so it is supported on *Omnia* and
*Turris 1.x* routers at the moment. MOX has only one red diode and so no big
effect can be achieved there.
