# Christmas

Shine Turris Omnia like a Christmas tree.


## Description

A Python daemon for Turris Omnia to blink its RGB LEDs like a Christmas tree.

Only *Turris 1.x* and *Omnia* routers are supported because MOX does not have RGB LED(s).
*Turris 1.x* LAN leds share the color settings (5 out of 8 diodes have the same
color) so the effect is not so impressive there.
