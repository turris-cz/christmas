# Christmas

Shine Turris Omnia like a Christmas tree.


## Description

A Python daemon for Turris Omnia to blink its RGB LEDs like a Christmas tree.

Only *Omnia* is supported because MOX does not have RGB LED(s) and *Turris 1.x*
LAN leds can not be controlled separately (5 out of 8 diodes must share the
same color).
